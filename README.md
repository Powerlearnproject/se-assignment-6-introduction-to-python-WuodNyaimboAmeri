# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
        - Python is a popular programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Some key features include:
     Readable Syntax: Python uses indentation to define code blocks, making it easy to read and understand.
     Rich Standard Library: Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides modules for various tasks.
     Dynamic Typing: Variables are dynamically typed, allowing flexibility in assigning values.
     Interpreted Language: Python code is executed line by line, without the need for compilation.
     Use cases:
     Web Development: Python frameworks like Django and Flask are widely used for web development.
     Data Science: Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib) are essential for data analysis and visualization.
     Automation and Scripting: Python simplifies repetitive tasks and system administration.
     Machine Learning and AI: Python is the language of choice for building ML models.
     Scientific Computing: Researchers and scientists use Python for simulations and modeling.

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
      - To install Python:
    Visit the official Python website and download the installer for your OS.
    Run the installer and follow the prompts.
    Verify the installation by opening a terminal/command prompt and typing python --version.
    Set up a virtual environment using venv or virtualenv.

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
       - Example program:
          print("Hello, World!")
    Basic syntax elements:
    print(): Function to display output.
    Strings: Enclosed in single or double quotes.
    Comments: Prefixed with #.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
       - Basic data types:
    Integers (int), Floating-point numbers (float), Strings (str), Booleans (bool).
    Example:
    age = 30
    name = "Alice"
    is_student = True

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
       - Conditional statements (if, elif, else):
    if age >= 18:
        print("You're an adult.")
    else:
        print("You're a minor.")
    
    Loops (for, while):
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
       - Functions are reusable blocks of code.
    Example:
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b
    
    result = add(5, 3)
    print(result)  # Output: 8

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
       - Lists (ordered, mutable):
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    numbers.append(5)
    
    Dictionaries (key-value pairs):
    person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
    print(person["name"])  # Output: Alice

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
       - Handle errors using try, except, and finally blocks.
    Example:
    
    try:
        result = 10 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero")
    finally:
        print("Cleanup code here")

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
       - Modules: Python files containing functions, classes, or variables.
    Packages: Organized collections of modules.
    Example (using math module):
    
    import math
    print(math.sqrt(25))  # Output: 5.0

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
       - Read from a file:
   
   with open("myfile.txt", "r") as file:
       content = file.read()
       print(content)
   
   - Write to a file:
   
   with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
       file.write("Hello, World!")

# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
